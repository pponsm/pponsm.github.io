                    <p>I was born and raised in Mexico City and moved to Ireland for college. After a couple of years in a science-based major, I realized that I lacked a creative outlet, and so I moved to San Francisco to study English Literature as a major and Graphic Design as a minor. I aspire to combine these two fields and become a book designer. </p>
                    <p>I have always been interested in design and in making life a more aesthetic experience. Studying design, however, I have realized that it is inescapable. Graphic design, in particular, opened up a creative faucet that had gone unopened for too long. I find inspiration in the mundane, the ordinary, daily life, and my aim is to highlight the beauty of simplicity. Design has not only honed my attention to detail, but it has become my way of dealing with the stress of life. I particularly enjoy working in Illustrator, creating illustrations, posters, infographics, but I am also interested in Typography, and, of course, publication design. Whether through my work or as part of a team, I hope to add some beauty to everyday life.</p>
