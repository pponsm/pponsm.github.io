                        As a final project in a Visual Communications class, this accordion book aimed to showcase the life of a designer each student admired and was inspired by. Bea Feitler, celebrated Art Director for multiple companies, was the chosen designer. Her career, while shorter in comparison to that of her peers, was filled with color and movement, much of which was the inspiration for each spread. From designing book covers and event posters to being Art Director at Harper Bazaar and Rolling Stone to the revamp of Vanity Fair– her final project –Bea was a visionary. Because of her work in magazines, the accordion book was meant to replicate the look of a magazine, displaying Bea’s life works and her contributions to the world of graphic design, particularly for women. The spreads, as well as the color palette, were inspired by her designs.
